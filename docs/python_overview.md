# <span style="color:blue">Python Overview</span>

## What is Python?

Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** known for its **simplicity, readability, and versatility**. It is widely used for **web development, data science, automation, AI, and more**.

## What is a High-Level Language?

- A **high-level language** is a programming language that is **closer to human language** than to machine code.
- It allows developers to write code **without worrying about hardware details** like memory management.
- Examples of high-level languages: **Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, Ruby**.
- Pythonâ€™s syntax is simple and **resembles English**, making it easy to learn and use.

## Python is an Interpreted Language â€“ What Does That Mean?

- Python code is **executed line by line** at runtime, rather than being compiled into machine code before execution.
- This makes it **easier to debug** but can be slower than compiled languages like C or Java.
- The Python **interpreter** processes the code directly, allowing for **rapid development and testing**.
- You donâ€™t need to compile Python programs; just run them with

## Python Uses Indentation â€“ Why is This Important?

- Python **enforces indentation** (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define code blocks instead of using {} like in C or Java.
- This makes Python code **more readable and clean**.
- If indentation is incorrect, Python will throw an **IndentationError**.

## Simple and Readable Syntax 

- Pythonâ€™s syntax is designed to be **easy to read and write**.
- It resembles **natural English**, making it beginner-friendly.

Example:

```
	name = "Alice"
	print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

## Interpreted Language

- Python does **not require compilation** like C or Java.
- The Python **interpreter executes code line by line**.
- This makes debugging easier but may be slower than compiled languages.

## Dynamically Typed

- You **donâ€™t need to specify variable types** (e.g., int, string).
- Python automatically assigns data types based on the assigned value.

Example:
```
	x = 10 # Integer
	y = "Hello" # String
	z = 3.14 # Float
```

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

- Python runs on **Windows, macOS, Linux, and even embedded systems**.
- Write code once and run it anywhere without modifications.

## Object-Oriented and Functional Programming

- Supports **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** with classes and objects.
- Also supports **functional programming** using lambda functions and higher-order functions.

## Extensive Standard Library

- Python comes with a **rich set of built-in libraries** for:  
    âœ… File handling (os, shutil)  
    âœ… Math operations (math, random)  
    âœ… Web development (Flask, Django)  
    âœ… Data science (pandas, numpy, matplotlib)  
    âœ… Machine learning (scikit-learn, tensorflow)

## Open Source and Community Support

- Python is **free and open-source**.
- Has **one of the largest programming communities**, making it easy to find help.

## Supports Multi-Paradigm Programming

- Python allows **procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles**.
- This flexibility makes it suitable for various types of applications.

## Automatic Memory Management

- Python handles memory allocation and garbage collection **automatically**.
- No need to manually manage memory, unlike in C or C++.

## GUI Programming Support

- Python supports **Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)** with libraries like:  
    âœ… Tkinter (built-in GUI framework)  
    âœ… PyQt (for advanced GUI applications)  
    âœ… Kivy (for cross-platform mobile apps)
