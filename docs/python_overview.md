<h1 style="color: blue;">Python Overview</h1>

## What is Python?

Python is a **high-level, interpreted programming language** known for its **simplicity, readability, and versatility**. It is widely used for **web development, data science, automation, AI, and more**.

## What is a High-Level Language?

- A **high-level language** is a programming language that is **closer to human language** than to machine code.
- It allows developers to write code **without worrying about hardware details** like memory management.
- Examples of high-level languages: **Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, Ruby**.
- Python’s syntax is simple and **resembles English**, making it easy to learn and use.

## Python is an Interpreted Language – What Does That Mean?

- Python code is **executed line by line** at runtime, rather than being compiled into machine code before execution.
- This makes it **easier to debug** but can be slower than compiled languages like C or Java.
- The Python **interpreter** processes the code directly, allowing for **rapid development and testing**.
- You don’t need to compile Python programs; just run them with

## Python Uses Indentation – Why is This Important?

- Python **enforces indentation** (whitespace at the beginning of a line) to define code blocks instead of using {} like in C or Java.
- This makes Python code **more readable and clean**.
- If indentation is incorrect, Python will throw an **IndentationError**.
